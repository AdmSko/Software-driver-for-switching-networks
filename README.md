Two versions of the software were created, one uses the CLI (OSPK_CLI) and the other uses the kivy framework to implement the GUI (OSPK_GUI)

 Software-driver-for-switching-networks
This project focuses on developing a software driver for switching networks, implementing various algorithms for connection control, including Clos, Benes, Cantor, and Paul, on a Clos switching field structure of arbitrary sizes. The software aims to efficiently manage and control network connections using these algorithms.

The key elements of the project:
-Implemented Algorithms: Clos, Benes, Cantor, Paul
-Switching Field Structure: The software supports the Clos switching field structure, scalable to different sizes.
-Programming Language: Python
-Documentation: The code includes documentation and variable names in Polish to meet project requirements. A future version in English will be developed.

Objective:
The goal is to design and implement algorithms for controlling connections in switching networks, with particular focus on the Clos architecture. The software will allow testing and simulation of these algorithms in telecommunication environments.

Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python
Tools: Python libraries (e.g., for simulation and testing)

Project Scope:
Implementing connection control algorithms (Clos, Benes, Cantor, Paul) on a Clos switching field.
Providing full code documentation and comments in Polish, with an English version planned for future release.
Testing and validating the implementation on different network sizes and configurations.

Future Development:
The project will be expanded with an English version of the code and further enhancements for more advanced switching structures or additional algorithms.
