# Software-driver-for-switching-networks
This project focuses on developing a software driver for switching networks, implementing various algorithms for connection control, including Clos, Benes, Cantor, and Paul, on a Clos switching field structure of arbitrary sizes. The software aims to efficiently manage and control network connections using these algorithms.
